    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      It's not as easy as we initially thought to break a task down into smaller ones. <br>
      Sometimes it's harder to explain and deconstruct things that we thought we know well.
    </p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>
			The biggest Problem is we don't know if the logic and method are right or not. They may not work like<br>
			we thought when we are actually coding
    </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
			So we add some steps to Tic-Tac-Toe game And create a Tetris game. While We are creating Tetris We found We also need a system that store and show the score. So we come up a idea to create a sub-progrom that do this job. Everything in below are explained in sub comment.
    </p>
    <code>
      <pre>
							//Creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game:

							//Print the board before each turn.
							//Accept user input
							  //Check the input is valid or not
							//Validate user more
							//Evaluate possible moves
							//Check if there are two computer’s pieces on the line to make the move to win the game.
							  //Check if there are two opponent ‘s pieces on the line make the move block that line.
							//Choose computer move
							  //If all above test fail Make random choose
							//Test for Win! Condition
							  //Run a test each move are done if there are 3 on the line then end the game
							  //Check who made that move
							//Show who is the winner

							//Creating a Tetris game.

							//Print the user interface each round
							  //Game start option
							  //Difficult level option
							  //Score board
							  //Read the highest score and current score the display them
							  //The block that come up next
							  //Read the step2 system
							  //Time
							    //A clock that adjust the blocks falling speed
							//Set up a system that control random pieces are falling
							//Accept user input
							  //Direction key
							  //Extra key for quick drop the block
							//Adjust the falling speed. Make it become quicker and quicker
							  //Set up a test that check the time
							//Pieces cancel out
							  //Test if there is line that full fill with blocks
							  //Test if there are multiple line full fill with blocks
							//Test for Game End condition
							  //While the blocks reach the ceiling game end
							  //Save the score and compare to the highest score
							  //If the current score is higher than the highest score replace it and show up an award
							//Print the game end UI and restart option.



							//Bouns:

							//Creating a system that store the highest score in the game

							//Create a array that store numbers
							  //This array need to store 10 numbers
							  // Compare each number and arrange them from highest to lowest
							//Print them from highest to lowest
							  //Every time there is input(new game score) compare it to the array
							  //Start with the highest number if not go to the next
							  //While the the test is pass replace that order and adjust the order
							  //Delete the lowest(This system can store up to 10)
							//Output the list to the game let game show the list.
