    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      This assignment makes me feel the real coding process. We faced some problems.
      JunYao follows the steps from lecture to do task 2, but it doesn't work out.
      ZiHan tried it again and it works. Both of us donâ€™t know why. However, JunYao tried the second time it worked too.
    </p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>
      First, we follow steps from the lecture but it doesn't work out in the beginning.
      Then, we have no clue how to do the bonus. Anyway, we found some solutions from the internet.
      Although not all of them are working, we tried them one by one and fixed them.
    </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
      After we tried multiple times the code finally. Also, we found a lot of help from the internet.
